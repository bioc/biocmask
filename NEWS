* `print.SummarizedExperiment` has been renamed to 
  `show_tidy.SummarizedExperiment` and `show_tidy` is exported as an S3 generic.
* Adjust show function display original show method by default. using 
  `show_tidy()` is now opt-in via options or `use_show_tidy()`.
* Verbose messages checking if `tidySummarizedExperiment` is already attached or
  ever becomes loaded with `biocmask`.
* change README and Vignette explaining this package provides an alternative 
  approach to `tidySummarizedExperiment` to manipulating `SummarizedExperiment`
  objects. For now they are exclusive in their functionality, but there may be
  plans to reconsile conflicts in the future!
