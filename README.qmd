# `biocmask`

`biocmask` provides efficient abstractions to the *SummarizedExperiment* such
that using common dplyr functions feels as natural to operating on a
*data.frame* or *tibble*. `biocmask` uses 
[data-masking](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/topic-data-mask-programming.html) 
from the `rlang` package in order to connect dplyr functions to
*SummarizedExperiment* slots in a manner that aims to be intuitive and avoiding
ambiguity in outcomes.

***Note:***  This package is still under active development as of Fall 2024.
